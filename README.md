# FaceBomp Game

Welcome to **FaceBomp**, a delightful and whimsical game that combines quick reflexes, silly faces, and a dash of competitive spirit. In this engaging web-based experience, you’ll find yourself bopping faces faster than a caffeinated monkey on a trampoline! 🐒💥

## The Concept
The premise is simple: Faces will randomly pop up from their hiding spots, and your mission is to **bop** them as swiftly as possible. Each successful bop earns you points, and the clock is ticking! Can you achieve the highest score before time runs out? Let’s find out! 😄

## How to Play
1. **Click the “Start Game” Button**: The game kicks off when you bravely click that enticing “Start Game” button. Brace yourself!
2. **Face Pop-Up Extravaganza**: Faces will appear in the holes on the game board. These aren’t just any faces; they’re quirky, goofy, and downright hilarious. Keep your cursor ready!
3. **Swift Bopping Action**: As soon as a face emerges, give it a satisfying click! Your nimble fingers will earn you points. But beware—the faces won’t wait around forever!
4. **Time Is of the Essence**: You have a mere 30 seconds to rack up as many points as possible. Keep an eye on the timer—it’s your trusty companion in this face-bopping adventure.
5. **Scoreboard Glory**: Your hard-earned points will be proudly displayed at the top. Can you ascend the ranks and become the ultimate FaceBomp champion?

3. **Bop Away!**: Click those faces like a pro. Bonus points if you make funny sound effects while doing so!

## Technologies Used
* **HTML**: The backbone of our game. Faces need a home, after all!

* **JavaScript**: The conductor orchestrating the face-popping symphony. It’s where the magic happens.

## Customization and Beyond
Feel free to unleash your creativity:

* **Add More Faces**: Why stop at six? Populate the game board with an entire gallery of expressive faces.
* **Sound Effects**: Enhance the experience with delightful boops, bings, or even kazoo sounds when you bop a face.
* **Themes**: Change the background gradient, fonts, or even introduce a day-night cycle. The sky’s the limit!
